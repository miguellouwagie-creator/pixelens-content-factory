Your client doesn't care about your 'complex state management'. They care about bounce rates.\n\nWe audited 50 agency sites. The ones built with Astro loaded 40% faster and converted 15% better. Stop over-engineering. Ship HTML. \n\n#astrojs #webperformance #webdesign #agencygrowth",

We are seeing a massive shift away from huge hero sections with vague copy. \n\nThe new meta? Bento Grids that mix functional widgets, raw photography, and micro-interactions. It’s not just aesthetic; it's high-density information architecture. \n\nSwipe to see how we reorganized a SaaS dashboard using a modular Bento layout. Engagement went up 3x because users could find everything instantly. \n\n#uidesign #bentogrid #saasdesign #uiux2025 #productdesign",

Framer isn't a 'no-code toy' anymore; it's the professional standard for shipping fast.
